			<h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
			<p class="para"> Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory.
			The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment) or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment) and is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment.
			In this way, augmented reality alters oneâ€™s ongoing perception of a real world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real world environment with a simulated one.
			Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.</p>
			
			
			<p class="para"> Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. 
			With the help of advanced AR technologies (e.g. adding computer vision and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulable. 
			Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world. 
			This information can be virtual or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment with where they actually are in space.
			Augmented reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge.
			Augmentation techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic context with environmental elements. 
			Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined with supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. 
			This combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads up display technology (HUD). </p>

				<h4>Virtual Classroom 
				<span>A virtual classroom is a teaching and learning environment where participants can interact, communicate, 
				view and discuss presentations, and engage with learning resources while working in groups, all in an online setting.  
				</span>  The medium is often through a video conferencing application that allows multiple users to be connected at the same time through the Internet, 
				which allows users from virtually anywhere to participate.</h4>
				<p class="para"> There is no concrete definition of what a virtual classroom is,
				but the most logical one is simply that it is an online classroom environment facilitated via specialized video conferencing applications. 
				The participants, of course, include one or multiple instructors and students. 
				However, a classroom or class does not always need an active instructor to supervise students; in this setting, 
				they can proceed at their own pace, with the instructor only around to evaluate the students; sometimes there is no instructor at all. 
				This type of virtual classroom is called an unsupervised virtual classroom, 
				which is characterized by ready-made learning materials that students can follow without the aid of an instructor, 
				essentially a self-paced tutorial course where the exams can be automated after every activity. 
				This is the most common form of virtual classroom, where students just read a PowerPoint presentation or watch a video tutorial. 
				This makes YouTube, by association, the most widely used virtual classroom thus far (even if it is not considered as one). </p>
